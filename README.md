### Hey there â€” Iâ€™m Rafael! ðŸ‘‹  
Backend & distributed-systems enthusiast based in London, UK

Iâ€™m a Computer Science **graduate** who loves turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. My work (and late-night tinkering) lives at the intersection of  

* **Functional programming** â€” mostly Clojure and Elixir, plus FP-inspired patterns in Python  
* **Distributed systems & cloud infrastructure** â€” building resilient, scalable services  
* **Python back-ends** â€” REST & GraphQL APIs, event-driven architectures, data pipelines  
* **Data science + ML** â€” grounding design decisions in solid stats and model-driven insight  

What youâ€™ll find here: clean, well-documented repos, an obsession with testing & CI, and the occasional rant about type systems.
