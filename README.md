### Hey there — I’m Rafael! 👋🌍  
Backend & distributed-systems enthusiast based in London, UK 🏙️🇬🇧

I’m a Computer Science **graduate** who loves turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. My work (and late-night tinkering) lives at the intersection of  

* **Functional programming** — mostly Clojure ☘️ and Elixir 🧪, plus FP-inspired patterns in Python 🐍  
* **Distributed systems & cloud infrastructure** — building resilient, scalable services ⚙️☁️  
* **Python back-ends** — REST & GraphQL APIs 🔗, event-driven architectures ⚡, data pipelines 🚚  
* **Data science + ML** — grounding design decisions in solid stats 📊 and model-driven insight 🤖🧠  

What you’ll find here: not much yet—this account was recently hacked 😅🔐, so I’m busy restoring and rebuilding!
